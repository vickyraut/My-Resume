  summary: During the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly (Vidhan Sabha) election, my school served as an election center. While I was in the 10th standard at the time, I had the opportunity to participate as a student volunteer. Our responsibilities included assisting individuals in finding their correct voting centers, aiding election officers in maintaining order and discipline, extending support to the elderly, and even organizing wheelchair services for differently-abled individuals. It was a remarkable day filled with a sense of accomplishment, and as a token of appreciation for our dedicated efforts, we received a modest honorarium from the election officers at the end of the day.
